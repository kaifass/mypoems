title: "Birthday -_poem_"

Birthdays full of presents  
Birthdays full of rhyme  
A birthday all for you  
For others to honor  
And you to honor them  
You can give me  
All the presents you want  
I'll take them  
But that's not the point  
the point is it's your  
Birthday you've been living for another year  
And we'd like to honor that  
And give you all we can.
